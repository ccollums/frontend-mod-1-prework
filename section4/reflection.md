## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
 - It was not that different from what I typically do. I tend to set a certain period of time for complete focus and then I know I will get about a 10 minute break. I tend to make my focus time longer than 25 minutes at a time, usually about an hour.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- As previously mentioned, this is something I have always done. I will put everything away except my work and tell myself okay you are not stopping until this task is done, or this time limit is up. I think it works very well for me, I tend to stay hyper focused for that time limit or until that certain task is complete.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- An object is a database for storing and organizing data. An array is simply a list of data types, where an object has the ability to customize something so that the computer recognizes that all the variables you are setting make up that object. An array can be inside of an object.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - array, because it is simply a list of one thing
  * List of states and their capitals - object because it is two things. Name could be stateCapitals, each state being the variable set to the capital.
  * List of things to pack for vacation - this could be an object because it could get pretty complex. Could name it vacationPacking and have each section of things you need to bring as a variable within the object, then using integers to list how many of each, or arrays within the object.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array, simple list
  * List of student names and their cohort - object because it includes two parts, would do similar to the capital example.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - object because it is more complex and needs more data. Could make the object name cake and then list each ingredient with the amount for each.  
  * All my favorite restaurants - array, just a simple list that doesn't need to be made into an object

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- Another application that I use frequently is the health app on my phone. Which eventually is displaying things like steps, heart rate, floors climbed, active minutes. These could all be circumstances of a transaction item object because these keys are dynamic and ever changing, and then get displayed to me once I request them. 

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- I am slightly confused on the object instances. In that variable you are manually entering each value that is going to go into the keys, which seems rather time consuming when thinking about an application, is this something that can be set up to auto populate when information is entered into an application?
