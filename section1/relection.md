## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- I found it interesting to read what someone else thinks about how to be a "SuperLearner."
- On this list, I already read a lot and take pretty good care of my brain. I do this by eating pretty healthy, exercising and getting enough sleep and water. I also think that I adopt a growth mindset by being very adaptable.
- Something I would like to adopt is teaching others what I know and taking more breaks instead of grinding with no breaks for hours at a time.
- I can't think of anything I would add to the list, I think that they hit everything that I would agree on.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- String: Any data that contains letters, characters, numbers all wrapped in quotes.
- Number: A number that can be positive, negative, decimals, or zero.
- Boolean: Is always true or false, used to answer questions (yes/no questions).


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- You would start it with // and then start writing your comments line by line.
- Code comments are very important for collaborating with others so that they can read your intentions/reasoning in written/spoken english. We can also use it to organize our own thoughts in our code, and deactivate parts of our code to keep it from running temporarily. 

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- In the simplest way a variable is a "thing" it can literally be anything, an object, number, phrase. Anything that describes something and can vary or change.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- Twitter
- Tweets are most likely a variable and these would be strings.
- Years active could be another variable that would be a number.
- Lastly, username would be a string.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- The action of linking/joining things together. In JavaScript we do this by adding a (+) operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
- I am going to use Urban Outfitters as an example and say that when you purchase something the string you get back could be concatenation. It will say something like "Thank you for purchasing __ your order number is _____ and here is your tracking number ____" All of those spaces are where variables are being linked into the entire string.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- What is used more in practice, concatenation or interpolation? Since they seem to do basically the same thing, is one better to use than the other?
