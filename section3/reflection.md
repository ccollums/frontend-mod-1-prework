## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Something that really resonated with me from the article was the point that mistakes are essential to learning. I really relate to this point because I find that whenever I make a "mistake" I will never forget that thing again, which makes it a really important part of learning. This is how I know that I have a growth mindset. Another point that resonated with me was believing that you can improve your coding skills with effort and practice. I think coming into this field it is going to feel like a lot of imposter syndrome, and knowing that the more you practice and the more effort you put in the more you will continue to learn and grow.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- The biggest way I demonstrate a growth mindset is that I do believe that we are all continually growing, changing, learning and I think every day I try to grow not only my skills but who I am as a person. Like I stated above, I also know and believe that mistakes are essential to learning. Once I make a mistake it is stored in my brain on how to do it correctly the next time. One thing that I do not do as much that I would like to improve on is focusing on the process, focusing on what you are doing and why and also just really believing that the more effort I put in the better I can be.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Twitter: there are many different examples of arrays within Twitter. Some could be an array of who you follow, who follows you, your tweets, and your media(photos).

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- A method is essentially a function that only works with certain types of variables. An array method performs a specific array function, like taking the first element in the array away, or adding an element to the end of the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of a loop is to perform repeated tasks to meet a condition.
Or to get an output of something over and over again, and to check that each element in an array has met the conditions you are repeating.
- You may be using an array if you have a list of something that you need to add conditions to, or without you may just be creating a list. For example if you have an array of names and want to loop through and have happy birthday added to each name then you are using an array in the loop. If you just want to print out the numbers of a loop then you are not using an array. 

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- I would say that a loop looks at the first thing in a list and sees if it is true or false based off of what we are asking it, then it goes to the next thing in the list to see if that is true or false, it will keep going through the list like this until it comes to a false answer, and then the loop will stop.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I am interested to know how loops come into play when coding on more of a complex side. Do loops get rather large or are they typically broken down into smaller loops?
