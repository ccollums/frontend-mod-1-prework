## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I think that I sometimes have a hard time asking questions because I want to figure things out on my own. I think this could both positively and negatively effect me at Turing. On a positive side, I will tinker with things more, get better at Googling and try to work through problems on my own. But one of the blog posts made a valid point about wasting your own time when you could have reached out for help. I have an easier time asking questions one on one than in public settings, like class, or a slack channel. This is something I hope to overcome. I liked the idea in the blog of setting a timer for 20 minutes, and if you still haven't made any progress on the problem, it is time to ask for help.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- I enjoyed this method of learning, because I am very much someone that learns better when actually doing, and teaching myself. If everything is right there in front of me I do not find it as beneficial to actually retain information. The only uncomfortable thing about it was not knowing for sure if I was doing the right thing.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement tells the computer to do one thing or another based on a set of criteria, if/else if/else statements are conditional statements.
- A daily life example would be I am going to make oatmeal, if I have a peanut butter to put in it, or else I am going to make pancakes.
- I am sure conditions are used constantly in websites, one example would probably be if you enter a password into a site that is not meeting all of the conditions of creating that password (like having 8 characters, 1 number etc) and it will return that you have not met the qualifications, until you do.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- You add else if and else to the if statement in order to create multiple conditions. The program reads them one by one starting with the first one and determines if they are true or false compared to the stated variable. It will then put your output based off if they are true.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- I would say that something available to the developer is the value of the variable. We can see what the variables are and already determine if the conditions will be met based off of that. This would work for two or one condition before you even need to run the code. Sometimes you could also look at code comments to determine this. 

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- I don't have an specific questions on 'if' statements at the moment.
